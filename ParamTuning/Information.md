Grid Search. Parameter tuning was obtained through a grid search that accounted for the temporal progression of the data, considering the four trimesters of 2020. Briefly, we iteratively trained our models on the first; first and second; and first, second, and third trimesters, and we test on the remaining trimesters respectively (second, third, and fourth; third and fourth; and fourth). We chose the best parameter combinations for each model based on the median balanced accuracy.
