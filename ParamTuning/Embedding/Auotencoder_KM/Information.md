Information

Each main folder contains code used for parameter tuning. Inside these main folders, there are subfolders. Each subfolder is named in a specific format: “parameter_name_value”.
Here, “parameter_name” refers to the specific parameter that is being tuned for a model. For example, in the case of the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) model, “nu” is a typical parameter.
The “value” in the subfolder name indicates the specific value that the parameter is set to for that particular run of the model.
So, if you see a subfolder named “nu_0.5”, it means that the code inside that folder is set up to run the OCSVM model with the “nu” parameter set to 0.5.
This structure allows for organized and systematic tuning of model parameters. Each subfolder represents a different configuration of the model.
