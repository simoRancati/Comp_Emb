**Training and Evaluation**

Training and Evaluation of models. We trained our models using the GISAID Spike proteins in 2021, focusing on the Alpha and Delta variants. For testing, we used sequences from 2022 and 2023 (up to Nov. 8), when Omicron variants were spread. We evaluated the models using 16 dominant Omicron lineages identified as true positives, calculating metrics such as Precision (Pr), False Positive Rate (Fpr) and Balanced Accuracy (Ba).
